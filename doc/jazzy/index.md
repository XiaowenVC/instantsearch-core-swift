# Reference

This is the reference documentation for the **InstantSearch Core for Swift** library.

It has been automatically generated from the sources. You can always browse the latest official version [online](https://community.algolia.com/instantsearch-core-swift).


## Objective-C

Although the library is written in Swift, it is fully usable from Objective-C. Unfortunately, [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) (the tool we use to generate this documentation) does not yet support generating Objective-C documentation from Swift code, so you will have to guess the selector names (but Xcode's autocompletion should be your friend).

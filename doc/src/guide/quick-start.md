# Quick start

## Setup

- Add a dependency on "InstantSearch-Core-Swift":

    - CocoaPods: add `pod 'InstantSearch-Core-Swift', '~> 2.0'` to your `Podfile`.

    - Carthage is not supported. [Wondering why?](./miscellaneous.html#why-is-carthage-not-supported)

- Add `import InstantSearchCore` to your source files.

**Note:** If you wish to use the API Client's offline mode, use the spec `InstantSearch-Core-Offline-Swift` instead.


## Examples

A good start is our [Movie Search demo](https://github.com/algolia/algolia-swift-demo), which makes extensive use of the InstantSearch.

Change Log
==========


## 1.0.1 (2017-04-03)

### Bug fixes

- Upgrade to version 4.8 of the Swift API Client (fixes compilation issue)


## 1.0 (2016-12-19)

**First official release!** üéâ Merry Christmas to everyone! üéÑ‚õÑÔ∏èüéÅ

### New features

- Leverage the new **search for facet values** feature of the Swift API Client. `Searcher.searchForFacetValues(...)` works like the equivalent method on `Index`, but automatically takes facet and numeric refinements into account, as well as the conjunctive/disjunctive state of facets.

### Bug fixes

- Limit number of pending requests per `Searcher` instance. This is to avoid stalling the request queue if response times are long. The limit can be adjusted via `Searcher.maxPendingRequests`.

### Bug fixes

- Fix handling of numeric refinements when disjunctive faceting is used

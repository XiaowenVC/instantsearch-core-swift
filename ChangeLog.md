==========

## 3.0.0 (2017-10-01)

### Swift Version

- Add support for Swift 4

### Backward incompatibility

 `Highlighter` class: the `init` method changed from `init(highlightAttrs: [String: Any])` to `init(highlightAttrs: [NSAttributedStringKey: Any])`.

## 2.0.1 (2017-07-31)

### Dependency Managers

- Add support for Carthage

## 2.0.0 (2017-07-17)

This new major release has been made to adapt this core library to the needs of the [InstantSearch iOS library](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch-ios). 

### New Features

- Add more extensibility to the Searcher result handler methods. This brings changes in the signature of the `SearcherDelegate` method and the `searcher.resultHandlers`:
  - For the `SearcherDelegate`: From `searcher(_:didReceive:error:params:)` to `searcher(_:didReceive:error:userInfo:)`
  - For the `searcher.resultHandlers`: From `(results:error:)` to `(results:error:userInfo:)`
- Notifications sent when refinement changes through the `RefinementChangeNotification` notification name. You can use the `userInfoNumericRefinementChangeKey` and `userInfoFacetRefinementChangeKey` to listen to numeric and facet refinement changes.
- FacetResults class added that can be used for searchForFacetValues
- The Searcher now keeps the latest `hits` and `results` in its state
- Add helper to reverse highlights in a text
- Library's deployment iOS target moved from 9.3 to 8.0.

## 1.0.1 (2017-04-03)

### Bug fixes

- Upgrade to version 4.8 of the Swift API Client (fixes compilation issue)


## 1.0 (2016-12-19)

**First official release!** üéâ Merry Christmas to everyone! üéÑ‚õÑÔ∏èüéÅ

### New features

- Leverage the new **search for facet values** feature of the Swift API Client. `Searcher.searchForFacetValues(...)` works like the equivalent method on `Index`, but automatically takes facet and numeric refinements into account, as well as the conjunctive/disjunctive state of facets.

### Bug fixes

- Limit number of pending requests per `Searcher` instance. This is to avoid stalling the request queue if response times are long. The limit can be adjusted via `Searcher.maxPendingRequests`.


## 0.3.1 (2016-12-13)

### Bug fixes

- Fix handling of numeric refinements when disjunctive faceting is used


## 0.3 (2016-12-06)

- [refact] Rebrand as "InstantSearch Core for Swift". **Breaking change:** Names of Git repository, module and pod have changed.
- The `Searcher` class now accepts a delegate (in addition to result handlers and event notifications)
- [refact] New handling of query numeric and facet filters
- [doc] New documentation structure
- [test] Add unit tests for `Highlighter`


## 0.2 (2016-09-14)

### New features

- Support **Swift 3**
    - The naming has been revised to comply with the Swift API Design Guidelines
    - Better Objective-C mappings
- New `SearchProgressController` class

### Bug fixes

## 0.1 (2016-08-16)

**Warning:** Beta version. Until version 1.0 is released, incompatible changes may occur.

### New features
